   2. Use the translation filters provided by the app in your Liquid templates (e.g., `{{ 'hello' | t }}`).
   3. Create separate translation files for each language you want to support.
   4. Ensure that your theme's JavaScript and CSS are also translated appropriately.

8. **What are Shopify Theme Gems, and how do you use them?**
