## You need to interview the company as much as they interview you!

> Why? You need to work in a place where you feel great. Here are my top 3 questions to see how good their culture is:

1. Could you please give me some instances of how the company fosters employee growth and development?

2. Can you please tell me how the company promotes and enables team members to provide feedback to each other? Also, what measures are in place to ensure that the feedback is helpful and productive?

3. Can you provide any recent instances where the company tackled challenges or dealt with changes, and how did the employees play a role in that process?
