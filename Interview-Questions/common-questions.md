- Begin your response by acknowledging the weakness in a straightforward manner. This demonstrates honesty and self-awareness.

> Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.

- While attention to detail is crucial in frontend development, I've learned that striving for perfection on every task can sometimes lead to unnecessary delays or a reluctance to delegate.
- To address this, I've been working on balancing the pursuit of excellence with the need to prioritize tasks efficiently.
- I've also learned to recognize when a task reaches the point of diminishing returns and when it's time to move forward or seek input from colleagues.
- By embracing a mindset of continuous improvement and setting realistic expectations for myself, I've been able to manage this tendency more effectively and maintain a healthy balance between quality and productivity.

<details>
  <summary> <b>Click to view the answer.</b> </summary>
  
Respond to this kind of question with a compelling _story_ that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.
 
1. __Describe the situation.__

- Talk about the initial events that occurred.
- What were the problems that you were experiencing?
- What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have?
- This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about **three to four sentences**long.

2. **Get into the action.**

- Speak about the key milestones that you went through
- Tell them what you did to turn the situation around.
- Don't go into too much detail though.
- It should only be about _two to three sentences_, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.

3. **Show the results.**

- Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way.
- Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

**Example**
"In my role as a project manager at XYZ Company, I led a team to launch a new product amidst tight deadlines and numerous challenges. I fostered open communication, made tough decisions when necessary, and remained calm under pressure. One notable instance was when we faced a major technical issue just before the launch. I proactively worked with the team to find a solution, leveraging my technical expertise. Despite setbacks, we successfully launched the product on time, exceeding sales targets by 20%. This experience reinforced the importance of effective leadership, teamwork, and resilience."

### Q7. What are your salary expectations?

<details>
  <summary> <b>Click to view the answer.</b> </summary>
  
> Don't give a specific number. RANGE

1. **Give them a salary range.**

- Let them know there’s room to negotiate (instead of starting with a specific number).
- Avoid going too low though, because that's going to work against your interests.
- And don’t go too high either, or you may freeze yourself out of the opportunity.

2. **Do some neutral research.**

- Give them a reasonable place to start from.
- R&D: Then they’ll have to base their compensation at least on those numbers because you've let them know what other similar organizations are giving to employees who do that job.

3. **Bring up signing bonuses.**

- Doing this can create a win-win situation for both parties.
- At the end of a negotiation, asking for extra money up top is often a way to bridge the gap between what you want and what you’re being offered.

**Example Response:**

I appreciate the opportunity to discuss compensation. Based on my research and understanding of the industry standards for this position, as well as considering my qualifications and experience, I am seeking a salary in the range of [insert range]. However, I'm open to discussing the overall compensation package, including benefits and opportunities for growth and development.
