### Q18. What is virtual DOM?

<details>
  <summary> <b>Click to view the answer.</b> </summary>

- Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in a web browser.
- It's a lightweight copy of the real DOM that's created and manipulated by JavaScript frameworks like React.js.

- When changes are made to the UI in React, instead of directly updating the actual DOM, React first updates the Virtual DOM.
- Then, it compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and identifies the specific changes that need to be made to update the actual DOM efficiently.
- Finally, React applies only those necessary changes to the real DOM, minimizing performance overhead and improving the efficiency of UI updates.

In summary, the Virtual DOM helps optimize UI rendering by reducing unnecessary updates to the real DOM, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness in web applications.

### Q20. Cyclomatic complexity of a program

<details>
  <summary> <b>Click to view the answer.</b> </summary>

- Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to measure the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths through its source code.
- It helps in assessing the complexity of control flow within a program.

**The formula for calculating the Cyclomatic complexity of a program is:**

> V(G) = E - N + 2P

Where:

- \( V(G) \) is the Cyclomatic complexity.
- \( E \) is the number of edges in the control flow graph.
- \( N \) is the number of nodes in the control flow graph.
- \( P \) is the number of connected components (or regions) of the control flow graph.

Alternatively, it can be calculated using the following formula:

> V(G) = M - N + 1

Where:

- \( M \) is the number of decision points (e.g., if statements, loops, etc.).
- \( N \) is the number of nodes.

Both formulas yield the same result and represent the same concept of Cyclomatic complexity. This metric helps developers identify areas of code that might be difficult to understand, test, or maintain due to their complexity.

```js
function calculateCyclomaticComplexity(code) {
  // Count the number of edges
  const edges =
    code.split(
      /\bif\b|\belse\b|\belse\s+if\b|\bfor\b|\bwhile\b|\bdo\b|\bcase\b|\bcatch\b|\breturn\b|\b&&\b|\b\|\|\b/g
    ).length - 1;

  // Count the number of nodes
  const nodes = code.split(/;/).length;

  // Count the number of connected components (P)
  const connectedComponents = 1; // For simplicity, assuming all code is in a single connected component

  // Calculate Cyclomatic complexity
  const cyclomaticComplexity = edges - nodes + 2 * connectedComponents;

  return cyclomaticComplexity;
}

// Example code snippet
const exampleCode = `    function exampleFunction(x, y) {
        if (x > 0) {
            if (y > 0) {
                return "x and y are both positive";
            } else {
                return "only x is positive";
            }
        } else {
            if (y > 0) {
                return "only y is positive";
            } else {
                return "neither x nor y is positive";
            }
        }
    }`;

// Calculate Cyclomatic complexity of the example code
const complexity = calculateCyclomaticComplexity(exampleCode);
console.log("Cyclomatic Complexity:", complexity); // 7
```

| Security Testing    | Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a software system's security measures to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. |

1. **Smoke Testing:**

   - Checks if critical functionalities of the software work after a new build.
   - Broad and shallow, covering major features.
   - Helps ensure the build is stable for further testing.

2. **Sanity Testing:**
   - Validates specific functionalities or areas after changes or fixes.
   - Targeted and focused on recent updates.
   - Ensures changes haven't introduced major issues.

Both tests ensure the software is stable and functioning correctly before proceeding with more extensive testing.
