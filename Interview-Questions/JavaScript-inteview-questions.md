- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on webpages.
- It was originally developed by Netscape as a client-side scripting language but has since evolved into a versatile language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development.
    
    **Key features of JavaScript include:**
    
    1. **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript can hold values of any data type without explicit declaration.
    2. **Prototype-based Object-Oriented Programming**: JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classes for inheritance.
    3. **Functions as First-Class Citizens**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
    4. **Event-Driven Programming**: JavaScript allows developers to define actions that occur in response to user interactions or other events.
    5. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and can also be used on the server-side (e.g., with Node.js).

In JavaScript, there are primitive data types and object data type.

1. **Primitive Data Types**: These include strings, numbers, boolean, undefined, null, and symbols (introduced in ES6). They hold single values and are immutable (cannot change).
2. **Object Data Type**: Objects are collections of key-value pairs and are used to store complex data structures. Examples include arrays, functions, and custom objects.
