# MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- An initial version of a product designed to satisfy early customers and gather feedback for future development.
- Focuses on delivering essential functionalities that solve the primary problem or address the main need.
- Emphasizes launching quickly and then iterating based on user feedback.

### Prelaunch startup goals:

- Launch quickly.
- Acquire initial customers, particularly early adopters:

  - Early adopters are willing to try imperfect products because they have a pressing problem and are open to new solutions.
  - Communicate that while the product may not be perfect initially, it will continuously improve with their feedback.

- Engage with customers to gather feedback.
- Iterate on the product to improve its functionality.

# MVP Characteristics:

- Developed rapidly (weeks, not months).
- Contains limited functionality.
- Targets a specific, small set of users.
- Aim to solve urgent problems, targeting customers whose need is immediate.
- Mistake: **Avoid over building**

> "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution."
> "Don't become too attached to the MVP; it will evolve."

- Prioritize having a smaller group of dedicated users over a larger group of indifferent ones. [100 ‚ù§Ô∏è > 100000 üëç]
- It's acceptable for the MVP to lack scalability initially; focus on recruiting customers individually.
