# Two key players of Shopify

1. Merchants:

   Merchants are the people who use our platform to start, grow, and run their businesses.

   - They sell a wide variety of products and services to customers around the world, anywhere they happen to be.
   - They can sell online of in person.

     **Shopify Online stores**

     - Online marketplaces (Amazon)
     - Mobile Apps (Shop)
     - Social Media channels

     **In person**

     - Brick and mortar locations
     - Pop-ups stores
     - Events and festivals

   > Merchants make money by selling on Shopify, but what they sell can vary quite a bit. This ranges from physical or digital products, to memberships and subscriptions, to experiences and events, to classes and lessons and more.

2. Partners

   > Shopify Partners are key collaborators offer professional services to merchants and help introduce them to Shopify

   - themes and apps to give their buyers the best experience possible.
   - marketing and expanding their audience or
   - even product photography to add polish to their online store.

   **Branches:**

   - Shopify aims to build the best products and platform for merchants running their business and for the Partners who support them.

   > Shopify focus on building for the 80% while making the rest possible with Shopify Partners since we can’t possibly be everything to everyone.

## How do Shopify Partners work with merchants?

1. Themes
2. Apps (Building and Selling Apps)
3. Stores (Developing Stores/store setups)
4. Services (Offer services to grow their businees)

## How we define Shopify Partners to merchants

- Partners can create _one-size-fits-all_ products that are sold to many merchants, like apps or themes, and sell them on our public marketplaces (Shopify App Store or Shopify Theme Store) or

- they can work more directly with an individual merchant, understand their needs more deeply and provide custom solutions that meet their specific needs.

### A. Product Partnerships:

> Builds **one-size-fits-all** solutions that meet many merchants’ needs. Example: Shopify Plus Certified App Program

1. Foundational Partnerships:

   - Provides essential technologies that power the basic functions of the Shopify platform.
   - Example: Facebook or Stripe

2. Ecosystem:

   > Thriving ecosystem of developers.

   - They build and provide third party _1: many_ solutions that are not native to our Shopify platform.
   - This allows our merchants to seek out third party apps, payment gateways or themes for non-customized solutions.
   - Examples of these Partners include: App, theme, channel and payment gateway developers who may sell their services on Shopify's App/Theme Stores and Marketplaces

   > **Note:** When Shopify talks about Partners, we are generally referring to those who work directly with our merchants such as our developer, service, and Agency partners.

### B. Growth Partnerships

- Help merchants grow and bring new merchants onto the platform.
- Examples: Shopify Partner Directory; Affiliate program
- The highest tier of our Growth Partnerships are our Plus Agency Partners.
  - “Agency Partners” refers to a small or large company (not freelancer) who serves one or many merchants.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

> There are more than 2 million merchants on the Shopify platform.
