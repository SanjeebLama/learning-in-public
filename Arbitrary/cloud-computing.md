# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing platform refers to a virtualized computing environment delivered over the internet. It provides various computing services, including storage, processing power, networking capabilities, and software applications, to users on-demand.

Instead of owning physical hardware and managing infrastructure, users can access computing resources remotely from a cloud service provider.

Cloud computing platforms typically offer services in three main categories:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components to build their own IT infrastructure.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a platform allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. PaaS providers often provide development tools, middleware, and runtime environments.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access these applications through a web browser without needing to install or maintain software locally.

Examples of popular cloud computing platforms include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud. These platforms offer a wide range of services catering to the needs of businesses, developers, and individuals, enabling them to scale their operations efficiently, reduce costs, and innovate rapidly.
