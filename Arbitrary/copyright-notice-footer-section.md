Not anyone can simply write a copyright notice at the footer section of a website. There are certain criteria and legal requirements that need to be met in order to legitimately claim copyright ownership and display a copyright notice.

The copyright notice should only be used by the individuals or entities who hold the exclusive rights to the original work being displayed on the website. This typically includes:

1. **Personal Websites**: If you have created a personal website with original content such as articles, images, videos, or other creative works, you can include a copyright notice at the footer because you are the author and the copyright owner of that content.

2. **Commercial Websites**: Companies, organizations, or businesses that have created and own the content on their commercial websites (e.g., product descriptions, marketing materials, graphics, videos) can include a copyright notice as they hold the exclusive rights to that intellectual property.

3. **Websites with Licensed Content**: If a website includes content licensed from third-party sources (e.g., stock images, fonts, code snippets), the copyright notice should typically attribute ownership to the original creators or licensors of that content.

It's important to note that simply displaying a copyright notice does not automatically grant copyright protection. Copyright protection arises automatically when an original work is created and fixed in a tangible medium of expression. _However, the copyright notice serves as a public declaration of ownership and helps deter potential infringement by others._

If a website includes content from multiple sources or contributors, the copyright notice may need to reflect the specific ownership details accordingly. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional to ensure proper attribution and compliance with copyright laws.

In summary, while displaying a copyright notice at the footer is a common practice, it should only be used by individuals or entities who legitimately own the copyrights to the original content being displayed on the website.

## Displaying the Current year

There are a few reasons why websites often display the current year in the copyright notice at the footer section:

1. **Legal Requirements**: Copyright laws in most countries require that a copyright notice includes the year or years during which the copyrighted work was created or published. By displaying the current year, it shows that the copyright is up-to-date and covers the most recent content on the website.

2. **Indicating Ongoing Updates**: Websites are often dynamic and regularly updated with new content. By showing the current year in the copyright notice, it implies that the website is actively maintained and the copyright covers the latest additions or modifications to the content.

3. **Avoiding Outdated Information**: If a static year is used (e.g., Â© 2020), it can give the impression that the website hasn't been updated since that year, which may be inaccurate or misleading. Using the current year avoids this potential misunderstanding.

4. **Best Practice and Convention**: It has become a widely accepted convention and best practice to display the current year in website footers. This practice makes it clear that the copyright applies to the latest version of the website and its content.

5. **Automation and Dynamism**: Most modern web development frameworks and content management systems (CMS) have built-in functions or scripts that automatically update the copyright year in the footer section. This automated process ensures that the year is always up-to-date without the need for manual intervention.

While it is not strictly required by law to display the current year in the copyright notice, doing so provides clarity, transparency, and aligns with industry best practices. It ensures that the copyright notice accurately reflects the ongoing updates and maintenance of the website, protecting the intellectual property rights of the website owners or content creators.
