**Note:**

**Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) in Interview**

- DSA in interviews gauges problem-solving prowess.
- Requires foundational coding and data structure knowledge.
- Conceptual problem-solving is also viable.

> What do Software Engineers do? Manipulate data from one form to another
> All that FANG engineers do on day to day basis is to move data from one service to another.

**Data Structure:**

- collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the function or operations that can be applied to the data.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Evaluates algorithm efficiency, considering both time and space complexity.
- as there can be multiple ways to solve the same problem

**Time Complexity:**

- Measures algorithm speed using Big O notation.

**Space Complexity:**

- Measures auxiliary memory consumption using Big O notation.

Sure, let's simplify it:

### Memory

Memory is like a big canvas where computers paint pictures with tiny dots called bits. Each dot can be either black (1) or white (0).

- **Memory Slots**: Imagine memory as divided into small boxes. Each box can hold a certain number of dots, usually 8 dots in a group. We call this group a "byte".

- **Binary Representation**: Inside these boxes, computers write numbers using only dots. They count in a different way, using only 0s and 1s instead of 0 to 9 like we do. Each dot (bit) represents a number in this special counting system.

- **Bytes and Endianness**: Bytes are like Lego blocks of memory. They help organize the dots into chunks. Computers can store these chunks in different ways, like putting the biggest dots first or last. We call these ways "endianness".

Simplified table illustrating :

| Integer Value | Binary Representation      | Memory (Byte) |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 0             | 00000000                   | 1 Byte        |
| 1             | 00000001                   | 1 Byte        |
| 2             | 00000010                   | 1 Byte        |
| 3             | 00000011                   | 1 Byte        |
| 4             | 00000100                   | 1 Byte        |
| 5             | 00000101                   | 1 Byte        |
| ...           | ...                        | ...           |
| 255           | 11111111                   | 1 Byte        |
| 256           | 00000001 00000000          | 2 Bytes       |
| 257           | 00000001 00000001          | 2 Bytes       |
| ...           | ...                        | ...           |
| 65535         | 11111111 11111111          | 2 Bytes       |
| 65536         | 00000001 00000000 00000000 | 3 Bytes       |
| ...           | ...                        | ...           |

In this table:

- **Integer Value**: Represents the decimal value of the integer.
- **Binary Representation**: Shows how the integer is represented in binary form.
- **Memory (Byte)**: Indicates the number of bytes required to store the integer in memory. As the integer values increase, they may require more bytes to be stored, depending on the size of the integer data type used in the programming language or system.
